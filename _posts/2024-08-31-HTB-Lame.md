Welcome back to another HackTheBox walkthrough! In this post, we’ll be exploring **Lame**, a machine known for its beginner-friendly difficulty level. What makes this walkthrough special is that I’ll be showing you different methods to root the machine—both with and without using Metasploit. By the end, you’ll have a solid understanding of various exploitation techniques and how to apply them.

## Machine Overview

**Lame** is one of the easier boxes on HackTheBox, rated as "easy." It serves as an excellent introduction to penetration testing and CTF challenges. We’ll go through the steps of reconnaissance, enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation, showing multiple paths to root.

## Step 1: Reconnaissance

We start our journey by gathering as much information as possible about the target. Nmap is our tool of choice for initial reconnaissance.

### Nmap Scan

We’ll run an Nmap scan with the `-A` option to perform a detailed scan:

```
nmap -A 10.10.10.3
```

At this point, we've identified the services running on the target machine. The services that stand out are as follows:


| Port Number | Service     | Version                                                     |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 21/tcp      | FTP         | vsftpd 2.3.4                                                |
| 22/tcp      | SSH         | OpenSSH 4.7p1 Debian 8ubuntu1 (protocol 2.0)                |
| 139/tcp     | NetBIOS-SSN | Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)                 |
| 445/tcp     | NetBIOS-SSN | netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.0.20-Debian (workgroup: WORKGROUP) |

After conducting a full scan, we discovered an additional service of interest:

```
nmap -Pn -A -p- 10.10.10.3
```
The newly identified service is as follows:


|Port Number|Service|Version|
|---|---|---|
|3632/tcp|distccd|distccd v1 ((GNU) 4.2.4 (Ubuntu 4.2.4-1ubuntu4))|

Furthermore, we performed a more focused scan on this specific port:

```
nmap -Pn -p 3632 10.10.10.3
```
This scan confirmed the presence of the `distccd` service on port `3632`.


## Step 2: Enumeration

### FTP - TCP 21

We start by checking if the FTP service allows anonymous login:

```
ftp 10.10.10.3
```

After logging in as "anonymous," we find no valuable files

```
kali@kali:~$ ftp 10.10.10.3
Connected to 10.10.10.3.
220 (vsFTPd 2.3.4)
Name (10.10.10.3:kali): anonymous
331 Please specify the password.
Password:
230 Login successful.
Remote system type is UNIX.
Using binary mode to transfer files.
ftp> ls
200 PORT command successful. Consider using PASV.
150 Here comes the directory listing.
226 Directory send OK.
ftp> quit
221 Goodbye.
