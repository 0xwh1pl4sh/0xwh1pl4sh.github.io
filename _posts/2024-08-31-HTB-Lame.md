title: Hack The Box - Lame
category: tech
tags: ["tutorial"]
---

Welcome back to another HackTheBox walkthrough! In this post, we’ll be exploring **Lame**, a machine known for its beginner-friendly difficulty level. What makes this walkthrough special is that I’ll be showing you different methods to root the machine—both with and without using Metasploit. By the end, you’ll have a solid understanding of various exploitation techniques and how to apply them.

## Machine Overview

**Lame** is one of the easier boxes on HackTheBox, rated as "easy." It serves as an excellent introduction to penetration testing and CTF challenges. We’ll go through the steps of reconnaissance, enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation, showing multiple paths to root.

## Step 1: Reconnaissance

We start our journey by gathering as much information as possible about the target. Nmap is our tool of choice for initial reconnaissance.

### Nmap Scan

We’ll run an Nmap scan with the `-A` option to perform a detailed scan:

```
nmap -A 10.10.10.3
```

At this point, we've identified the services running on the target machine. The services that stand out are as follows:

```
| Port Number | Service     | Version                                                     |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 21/tcp      | FTP         | vsftpd 2.3.4                                                |
| 22/tcp      | SSH         | OpenSSH 4.7p1 Debian 8ubuntu1 (protocol 2.0)                |
| 139/tcp     | NetBIOS-SSN | Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)                 |
| 445/tcp     | NetBIOS-SSN | netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.0.20-Debian (workgroup: WORKGROUP) |
```
After conducting a full scan, we discovered an additional service of interest:

```
nmap -Pn -A -p- 10.10.10.3
```
The newly identified service is as follows:

```
|Port Number|Service   |Version                                         |
|-----------|----------|------------------------------------------------|
|3632/tcp   |distccd   |distccd v1 ((GNU) 4.2.4 (Ubuntu 4.2.4-1ubuntu4))|
```
Furthermore, we performed a more focused scan on this specific port:

```
nmap -Pn -p 3632 10.10.10.3
```
This scan confirmed the presence of the `distccd` service on port `3632`.


## Step 2: Enumeration

### FTP - TCP 21

We start by checking if the FTP service allows anonymous login:

```
ftp 10.10.10.3
```

After logging in as "anonymous," we find no valuable files

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/HTB/Machines/Lame]
└─$ ftp 10.10.10.3
Connected to 10.10.10.3.
220 (vsFTPd 2.3.4)
Name (10.10.10.3:kali): anonymous
331 Please specify the password.

230 Login successful.
Remote system type is UNIX.

ftp> ls
229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||29622|).
150 Here comes the directory listing.
226 Directory send OK.
ftp> quit
221 Goodbye.

```

let's do more enumeration. 

we identified the ftp version (vsFTPd 2.3.4). so a quick google search shows us that this version is famously vulnerable to a backdoor command execution that is triggered by entering a string that contains the characters `:)` as the username. When the backdoor is triggered, the target machine opens a shell on port `6200`. This exploit is simple enough to exploit manually but we’re trying to move to more automation so let’s see if there is an nmap script that already checks for that. (We will explore how the manual exploitation of this backdoor works later in the **Exploitation** section, and we'll dive deeper into it in the **Beyond Root** section.)

```
ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ftp*
```

Execute the script on port 21 of the target machine.

```
nmap --script ftp-vsftpd-backdoor -p 21 10.10.10.3
```

The script output shows that we’re not vulnerable to this vulnerability. 

Even we can use `searchsploit`  search for vulnerabilities associated with vsFTPd 2.3.4.

```
kali@kali:~$ searchsploit vsFTPd 2.3.4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Exploit Title                                           |  Path
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
vsftpd 2.3.4 - Backdoor Command Execution (Metasploit)   | unix/remote/17491.rb
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shellcodes: No Results
```

The description of **EDB-ID 17491** reveals that the `vsftpd-2.3.4.tar.gz` archive was compromised and backdoored for a specific period. Attackers introduced a malicious backdoor that could be exploited by entering `:)` as the username. However, this backdoor was identified and removed on July 3, 2011, closing the vulnerability.

###  SSH - Port 22 -(OpenSSH v4.7p1)

My go-to resource for checking [Ubuntu packages](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=openssh-server) doesn't list this version of OpenSSH, indicating that the operating system on the target machine is quite old. A quick Google search suggests that this version of OpenSSH is likely from [Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssh/1:4.7p1-8ubuntu1).

![Pasted image 20240831050426](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8579fe52-a82a-40dc-8554-ddfa0f1e795a)

![Pasted image 20240831050438](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58b993c4-f1b5-4b99-9eda-fa7636c0e1cc)

After a quick Google search, nothing major turns up regarding specific vulnerabilities for this version. However, `Nmap` includes multiple scripts capable of brute-forcing credentials, among other things. We can list the available SSH-related scripts with the following command:

```
ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ssh*
```

Since this process might take a while and could potentially lead us nowhere, we'll put this on the back burner for now and revisit it later if the other points of entry don't pan out.

### SMB  - Ports 139 and 445 (Samba v3.0.20-Debian)

We start by using `smbmap` to enumerate the available SMB shares on the target machine:

```
smbmap -H 10.10.10.3
```

The output indicates that only one share, `tmp`, is accessible without credentials:

```
root@kali# smbmap -H 10.10.10.3
[+] Finding open SMB ports....
[+] User SMB session established on 10.10.10.3...
[+] IP: 10.10.10.3:445  Name: 10.10.10.3
        Disk                                                    Permissions
        ----                                                    -----------
        print$                                                  NO ACCESS
        tmp                                                     READ, WRITE
        opt                                                     NO ACCESS
        IPC$                                                    NO ACCESS
        ADMIN$                                                  NO ACCESS   

```

Next, we try to enumerate the SMB shares using `smbclient`:

```
smbclient -L //10.10.10.3 -N
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/303bd0b7-04a4-47d9-a8df-19d155d5b6e6)

#### smbclient Error

Attempting to connect to the `tmp` share without credentials results in an error:

```
root@kali# smbclient -N //10.10.10.3/tmp
protocol negotiation failed: NT_STATUS_CONNECTION_DISCONNECTED
```

It turns out that my client is configured for security reasons to not connect to older SMB versions. To resolve this, I added the following line to my `/etc/samba/smb.conf` file:

```
[global]
client min protocol=NT1
```

Alternatively, We could add this as a command-line option:

```
root@kali# smbclient -N //10.10.10.3/tmp --option='client min protocol=NT1'
```

After making these adjustments, I successfully connected to the share:

```
Anonymous login successful
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> 

```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72610abe-5d1e-4a3d-bed8-3af43921bd2e)


However, logging in reveals that the `tmp` share is mapped to `/tmp`, and there doesn’t seem to be anything of interest.

#### **Searching for Vulnerabilities**

Let’s search for vulnerabilities associated with Samba smbd 3.0.20-Debian using `searchsploit`. The search results point us to **EDB-ID 16320** and **CVE-2007-2447**, commonly referred to as the Samba usermap script vulnerability:

```
kali@kali:~$ searchsploit samba 3.0.20
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Exploit Title                                                                                                           |  Path
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Samba 3.0.10 < 3.3.5 - Format String / Security Bypass                                                                   | multiple/remote/10095.txt
Samba 3.0.20 < 3.0.25rc3 - 'Username' map script' Command Execution (Metasploit)                                         | unix/remote/16320.rb
Samba < 3.0.20 - Remote Heap Overflow                                                                                    | linux/remote/7701.txt
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shellcodes: No Results

```

A closer look at **CVE-2007-2447** reveals that this vulnerability is associated with the username field in the Samba service. By injecting shell metacharacters into the username, we can execute arbitrary commands on the target machine. Although the [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/16320) available on Exploit-DB uses Metasploit, a closer examination of the script shows that it essentially runs the following command:


```
"/=`nohup " + payload.encoded + "`"
```
This command sends a reverse shell back to our attack machine. But before we exploit this vulnerability, let’s check out our last point of entry.

### Port - 3632 (distcc v1)

Googling **"distcc v1"** reveals that this service is known to be vulnerable to remote code execution. Fortunately, there's an `nmap` script that can verify this vulnerability. To check if the target is affected, use the following command:

```
nmap --script distcc-cve2004-2687 -p 3632 10.10.10.3
```

The results indicate that the target is indeed vulnerable!
